                <h3>⚠️ What you'll have to endure in Germany:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>🥨 Pretzel obsession:</strong> You'll be forced to eat giant pretzels bigger than your head (and love every bite)</li>
                    <li><strong>🍺 Beer gardens:</strong> Sitting under chestnut trees drinking beer at 2pm on a Tuesday will become completely normal</li>
                    <li><strong>🚗 Autobahn adventures:</strong> No speed limits = your new favorite roller coaster (with me as your co-pilot)</li>
                    <li><strong>🏰 Castle overload:</strong> Every hill has a fairy tale castle. Yes, ALL of them. It's ridiculous.</li>
                    <li><strong>🎄 Christmas markets:</strong> November to January = endless Glühwein and tiny wooden decorations you don't need but must buy</li>
                    <li><strong>🥾 Hiking addiction:</strong> Germans hike everywhere. In suits. With backpacks. You'll join them.</li>
                    <li><strong>🧀 Bread museum visits:</strong> Yes, that's a real thing. We have 300+ types of bread and we're proud of it</li>
                    <li><strong>⏰ Punctuality pressure:</strong> Being 5 minutes early is being late. You've been warned.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>💕 But here's the real danger...</h3>
                <p>You might fall so in love with this crazy country (and the girl showing it to you) that you never want to leave. Side effects include: permanent smiling, excessive use of German words, and an unexplainable urge to wear lederhosen.</p>

                <p><strong>Consider yourself officially warned.</strong></p>
