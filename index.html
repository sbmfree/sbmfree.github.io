                <h3>🇩🇪 Survival Tips for My Boyfriend's German Adventure:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>🥨 The Great Pretzel Conspiracy:</strong> They're everywhere. EVERYWHERE. You'll find yourself saying "Guten Tag" to pretzels. This is normal here. Don't fight it.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>🍺 Beer Math:</strong> 1L beer = breakfast. 2L beer = lunch. 3L beer = "I'm still sober enough to drive" (they're not, but somehow they are??)</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>🚗 Autobahn Reality Check:</strong> Speed limit? What's that? Your rental car will be passed by a grandma in a Mercedes going 200km/h while knitting.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>🕐 German Time:</strong> If you're not 15 minutes early, you're late. If you're on time, you're disrespectful. If you're late, you're probably dead to them.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>🥾 Hiking Obsession:</strong> Germans hike to the grocery store. In full hiking gear. With trekking poles. For a 5-minute walk. You will be judged for wearing sneakers.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>� Currywurst Confusion:</strong> It's curry powder on a sausage. That's it. Germans act like it's a Michelin star dish. Just smile and nod.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>🏰 Castle Overload:</strong> "Oh look, another castle!" - You, approximately 47 times per day. Every hill has one. It's like they had a castle contest and everyone won.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>🎄 Christmas Market Madness:</strong> November through February = mandatory Glühwein consumption. You'll buy 17 tiny wooden ornaments you don't need. This is the law.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>� The Toilet Shelf:</strong> German toilets have a shelf. Google it. I can't explain this. Nobody can. Welcome to trauma.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>🚪 Sunday Shutdown:</strong> Everything closes on Sunday. EVERYTHING. God himself apparently needs Germans to rest. You'll starve unless you plan ahead.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>💕 But here's the plot twist...</h3>
                <p>You'll probably fall in love with this absolutely ridiculous country and its weird customs. And more importantly, you'll be stuck with me as your tour guide through this beautiful chaos. I promise to protect you from the more traumatic experiences (like explaining why we eat raw pork).</p>
                
                <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Side effects may include: uncontrollable urge to say "Das ist ja toll!", addiction to Deutsche Bahn delays, and finding my terrible German accent adorable.</p>
